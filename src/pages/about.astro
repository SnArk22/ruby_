            <p>As as student at MIT, my current goal is to learn as much as possible, and gain as much experience as I can. In the long term I hope to have experiences, connections and skills I necessary to build technology that can have a tangible and positive impact on society and human health.</p>
            <h2>Academic Interests</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><h3>Bioprinting</h3>I’m currently interested in synthetic biology, tissue engineering and bioprinting, particularly the technologies that facilitate this. I think the future of organ transplants is going to be synthetic printed organs, and I can’t wait to help be a part of this process. </li>
                <li><h3>Prosthetics</h3>Another Interest of mine is human prosthetics. I wonder how the areas of bio-printing and tissue engineering can be applied in this area. I see a future where synthetic human tissues can be incorporated into prosthetics to increase their realism, sensitivity and effectiveness.</li>
                <li><h3>Botany</h3>Finally I have always had a passion for botany, and in recent days I have become enthralled by the process of genetically modifying plants. Though I don’t see any direct human applications from this I’m excited by the do-ability and wonder of genetics. I envision plants that could be more resilient, smell nicer or be more beautiful. Truly anything is possible!</li>
